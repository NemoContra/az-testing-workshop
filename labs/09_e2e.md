1. Check out the branch `start` (if have not done so yet).

```console
git checkout start
```

1. Open the folder `apps/az-testing-workshop/src/app/common`.

1. Here you will find some common functions of the app which needs for example mocking of a date.

1. Have a look on it and try to get an overview about the getNowDateString function.

1. Now open the `get-now-date-string.spec.ts` and have a look at the tests and try to understand it.

1. Execute the unit tests with `nx test az-testing-workshop -t getNowDateString` or use your IDE to execute the tests.

1. Now change the mocked date in line 3 and check what happens if you execute the test again.

1. If you are searching for an example solution checkout the branch `final`.

```console
  git checkout final
```
