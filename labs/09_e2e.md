# E2E-Tests

1. Check out the branch `start` (if have not done so yet).

```console
git checkout start
```

1. Open the folder `apps/az-testing-workshop/cypress/e2e`.

1. Here you will find the file `az-testing-workshop.cy.ts` which contains the e2e-tests of our application.

1. Have a look on it and try to get an overview what should be tested here and why.

1. You can start the e2e-tests with live-reloading with `nx e2e az-testing-workshop --watch`. You can do that already now so you can see the changes immediately after implementing.

1. Implement the missing e2e-tests.

1. If you are searching for an example solution checkout the branch `final`.

```console
  git checkout final
```
