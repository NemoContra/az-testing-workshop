# ContractService

1. Check out the branch `start` (if have not done so yet).

  ```console
  git checkout start
  ```

1. Open the folder `apps/az-testing-workshop/src/app/services`.

1. Here you will find the ContractService which is responsible for fetching all data from a backend within HTTP-calls.

1. Have a look on it and try to get an overview about all methods of the service.

1. Now open the `contract.service.spec.ts` and implement the already created empty tests.

1. When you are finished execute the unit tests with `nx test az-testing-workshop -t ContractService` or use your IDE to execute the tests.

1. If you are searching for an example solution checkout the branch `final`.

  ```console
    git checkout final
  ```
