# ContractDisplayComponent

## Notes

This repository contains two application inside the `apps directory`. An Angular app (az-testing-workshop) and a a Nest.js app which acts as a mock-backend. For this workshop we wil focus on the Angular app only.

1. Check out the branch `start`.

```console
git checkout start
```

1. Open the folder `apps/az-testing-workshop/src/app/components/contract-display`.

1. Here you will find the ContractDisplayComponent. A small component with only one input value.

1. Have a look at the `contract-display.component.html` and the `contract-display.component.ts` files and try to understand what the component does.

1. Now open the `contract-display.component.spec.ts` and implement the already created empty tests.

1. When you are finished execute the unit tests with `nx test az-testing-workshop -t ContractDisplayComponent` or use your IDE to execute the tests.

1. If you are searching for an example solution checkout the branch `final`.

```console
  git checkout final
```
